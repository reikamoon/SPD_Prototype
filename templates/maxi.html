  <div class = "biography"><p>Maxi's father had worked in the Ryukyu Kingdom as a merchant. Though fortunate enough to be able to experience different cultures on his trade route, he nevertheless felt tied down to his job, and would complain bitterly to his son. On his deathbed, he told Maxi to go out and see the world. Obeying his father's dying wishes, Maxi gathered friends from his hometown and some sailors he knew, and formed a pirate crew. A master of his native Ryukyu's martial arts, Maxi stood as a respected and trusted leader. He and his crew set sail, vowing never to be shackled by the whims of trade, and instead to relish the taste of freedom.
<br><br>
Though Maxi and his crew considered themselves pirates, they were not the barbarians one might expect. (Granted, some of their activities weren’t exactly lawful, and neither were they ones to shy away from a fight…) While the “fake Soul Edge” incident was admittedly a turn for the worse, it ended up proving just how capable Maxi and his crew really were. While facing similar adventures on their journey, they made their way by sea to India. What Maxi did not realize, however, was that fate had a cruel surprise in store...</p>
