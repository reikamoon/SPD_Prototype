  <div class = "biography"><p>Xianghua would not recognize her own father if he were to pass her in the street, because her mother had never spoken of him. Xianghua’s mother was from the prestigious Chai family in Beijing, and taught Xianghua swordsmanship from a young age, treating her with a firm but loving hand. Xianghua sensed those moments held some deeper significance than her mother was letting on… Perhaps it had something to do with her father, she surmised. Two years after her mother’s death, she decided to focus on the way of the sword. With every passing day, her passion burned ever more strongly.
<br><br>
The Ming Empire had created an investigation unit to look for the Hero’s Sword, but the unit’s efforts proved fruitless. Frustrated, the emperor deployed a unit comprised of his own personal guards, including Xianghua, who had fought hard to earn her place. Some believed entrusting such a task to the emperor’s guard was dangerous for the country: who would protect their leader? The news caused quite a stir. Xianghua’s friend Meimei requested she look for her brother Li Long, who went missing while searching for Soul Edge as part of the investigation unit… The emperor’s guard investigated the sword’s whereabouts, splitting up as they obtained new information, until eventually Xianghua was left traveling alone. Venturing westward, she met Kilik and Maxi. But what did their encounter mean? Was it fate? Of this, she couldn’t be sure yet.</p>
