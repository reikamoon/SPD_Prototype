  <div class = "biography"><p>Self-proclaimed "Studier of the Human Race," Azwel's love for mankind bordered on the fanatical. Blessed with an almost unwordly intelligence, he was a scholar in numerous fields, inclunding history, medecine, war and art. His research into human history in particular led him to conclude that people would eventually destroy themselves through war or some other catastrophe. In response, he decided to become the savior of humanity. As a member of the Aval Organization, he conducted research at a lightning pace, and concluded that by causing the powerful Evil Seed, humanity would be taken to its next level. Azwel's was such that it might soon rival even that of the gods themselves.
  <br>

Azwel's research at the Aval Organization had not been for nothing. He had concluded he was unable to obtain enough information about the cursed and spirit sword by himselfâ€”at the same time, however, he is also felt restricted in his movements within the organization. So when he became a member of the Twelve, he recruited crazed followers who would help. His actions, though, raised the suspicions of the organization. With his theories about the Ultimate Seed already formed, he was ready to take his plan to the next stage: by getting his hands on a fragment of both the spirit sword and the cursed sword, he could use their power to bring forth the Ultimate Seed. The day humanity would be saved was nigh! Just thinking about it filled Azwel with ecstasy...</p>
